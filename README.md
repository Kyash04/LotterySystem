This is a Python code where I have created a Lottery System in which the Registration time for the lottery have been set to 1 minute (can be extended). And the users must be more than 5.
If the registration period ends and the users registered is below 5 then the time will be extended by 1 minute (can be changed).
The username should contain alphabets, digits and underscores. If there are specail characters, it will display the message of invalid username.
If the users registered are 0 then it will display the message of 'No users registered'.
After the end of registration period and with sufficient users registered. It will randomly pick a winner.
All these data will be stored in a file name lottery_log.txt with the help of file handling.
